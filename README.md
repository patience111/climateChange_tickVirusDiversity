# climateChange_tickVirusDiversity
Climate factors showed stronger effect on the virome of H. longicornis. The most important climatic factors associated with the virome of H. longicornis were high temperature, and low relative humidity/precipitation, which increased the diversity, mainly the evenness of vertebrate associated viruses. The predicted diversity of the H. longicornis virome increased, under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios of climate change from 2019-2030 in 41.24%, 71.18% and 81.92% of regions, respectively, where it was currently present or predicted worldwide. Extension of surveillance programs to these regions might help to avert the development and spread of tick-borne diseases in the global population.
