# climateChange_tickVirusDiversity
Climate factors showed stronger effect on the virome of H. longicornis. The most important climatic factors associated with the virome of H. longicornis were high temperature, and low relative humidity/precipitation, which increased the diversity, mainly the evenness of vertebrate associated viruses. In this study, we developed a deep learning model for prediction tick virus diversity by six cliamte factors (feture climate data were downloaded from climate model of CMIP6).
